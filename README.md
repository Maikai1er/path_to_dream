This is a project to follow my dream - an IT career.
Basically, I hope to find my first job before finishing this project.
The concept is the following:
1. You have to register.
2. You add your dream in your Personal Area.
3. Each dream is a hard work, so basically you have to track the time spent to achieve it (you WILL have
the needed functionality).
4. The concept is that formally you will never achieve it, because if you stop - you lose the game of life.
5. Your purpose is to increase the probability of you dream to come true (hope I'll have this trackable).
